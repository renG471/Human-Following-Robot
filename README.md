# Human-Following-Robot
A mobile robot designed to autonomously follow a human in real time using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. The system continuously detects the user’s distance and direction, ensuring smooth tracking and obstacle avoidance. This project demonstrates practical applications in assistive robotics, personal mobility, and human–robot interaction.
